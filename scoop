scoop

nothin like a scoop

So since my original got blocked for sum people i will teach you how to make your own version of Jeowebsite >:D
so first step is to create a github account but when you select your username type the name that you would like your Jeo Copy link to start of with for example if your username is "catlover" when you create the website it will be "catlover.github.io"
after you created your github account you will go to this link "https://github.com/Jeowebsite/Jeowebsite.github.io" and you will create a "fork" when you name this fork make your its your username/website name then .github.io like "YOUR-USERNAME.github.io"
when you created your fork edit and commit a random file so it will let you post as a github page :D
after that you created your Jeowebsite copy and you should just be able to use your website after its done uploading which takes about 10 minutes
